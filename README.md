# Jsonpiler - JSON Syntax Programming Language

**Jsonpiler** is a compiler for the JSON syntax programming language and its compiler.

This program converts a JSON-based program to GNU assembly, compiles it, and executes the result.

## What's New

- Json objects now allow duplicate keys.
- **Objects are now treated as function calls**:  
  Each key in a JSON object is interpreted as a function name, and its corresponding value is treated as the function argument.
- **It is no longer allowed to assign a user-defined function to a variable name that already exists as a built-in function.**
- **Arrays now leave the result of evaluating all elements.**:  
- **Supports multiple key-function entries.**:  
  When an object contains multiple keys, each is evaluated in order; the last function result is returned.
- **Square brackets can now be omitted when a single argument is not an array.**
- **The `begin` function was removed because it can now be represented by a column of objects.**

## Prerequisites

**Make sure the following tools are installed and available in your PATH environment variable:**

- `ld` (from MinGW-w64)  
- `as` (from MinGW-w64)  

**The following DLLs must be present in `C:\Windows\System32\` for the program to work correctly:**

- `kernel32.dll`  
- `user32.dll`  
- `ucrtbase.dll`  

## Installation & Usage

```bash
cargo install jsonpiler
jsonpiler (input_json_file (UTF-8)) [arguments of .exe ...]
```

Replace `(input_json_file)` with the actual JSON file you want to compile.

## Example

[Examples](https://github.com/HAL-G1THuB/jsonpiler/tree/main/examples)

```json
{ "=": ["a", "title"], "message": [{"$": "a"}, "345"] }
```

**Execution order:**

The jsonpiler code consists of a single JSON object.

Expressions are evaluated sequentially.

The variable `"a"` is assigned the string `"title"` using `"="`.

A message box appears with the title (from the variable `"a"`) and the body `"345"` as specified by `"message"`.

The program returns the integer ID of the button pressed in the message box (currently only `1` is supported, which corresponds to `IDOK` in C/C++), as the final value of the `begin` block.

## Error message

```json
{ "message": ["title", { "$": "don't_exist" }] }
```

```text
Compilation error: Undefined variables: `not_exist`
Error occurred on line: 1
Error position:
{ "message": ["title", { "$": "don't_exist" }] }
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
